Take a look under "lib"

You should see two .jar files: "hamcrest-core-1.3" and "junit-4.12". If they're there,
leave them alone. If they're not, go look up JUnit online and download those two jar
files. (They should be easy to find.) Put them directly in the "lib" folder, not
in any of the subdirectories.

Now open the project in Netbeans as usual. All of our actual code is where it was before, nothing
should be different there.

You'll notice there are now two additional folders: Test Packages and Test Libraries. That's what
we're interested in right now.

Go to "Test Packages" and into "default package." (Apparently putting stuff in default package
is bad, but I haven't figured out how to put it anywhere else yet. For now, it'll work.)

There's a file called WireTest.java. It is, as the name suggests, a test to check that the Wire
class does what it's supposed to. Should be pretty clear how that works, there's comments
and all the code is pretty straightforward.

To run the test, right click on "default package" and click the option "Test Package."
In the area below, you should see something indicating that the tests passed.

If you're feeling ambitious and want to see what a failed test looks like, go into the WireTest code
and look for the fail case I've commented out. If you get rid of the comment marks the test
should now fail, and it will provide exact details about WHY the test failed.
